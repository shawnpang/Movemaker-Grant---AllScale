## 8. Introduction to Your Project
AllScale is a next-generation neobank empowering small businesses to scale globally faster with stablecoin.

## 9. Problem Statement
More and more businesses prefer—or even only accept—stablecoin, especially in the gig and creator economies. Influencers, freelancers, and contractors want to get paid in stablecoin, but traditional businesses lack a safe, fast, low-cost, and compliant way to handle it.

## 10. Proposed Solution
- **Payroll:** Automate cross-border payroll in stablecoins—simplify contractor payments, eliminate costly intermediaries, and ensure instant global delivery.
- **Invoicing:** Create, e-sign, and send professional contracts and invoices in seconds. Get paid by clients in their preferred method and instantly receive stablecoin—maximizing liquidity, minimizing friction.

We abstract away the complexity: payment aggregation, on/off ramp, KYC/KYB/AML, and business logic all happen under the hood.

## 11. Competitions
- Rise
- Request Finance
- BitWage

**Our Edge:** We are the only ones focused specifically on solving the needs of traditional small businesses.
